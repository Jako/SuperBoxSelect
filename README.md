# SuperBoxSelect

Advanced `Listbox` / `Resource List` template variable type for MODx Revolution 
based on the SuperBoxSelect ExtJS Plugin. The template variable displays 
selected items (i.e. resources or other supported types) as labelled boxes 
within the form field. The item(s) could be searched by autocomplete in the 
combo box. In the Input Options of the template variable are a lot of options 
available to i.e. the listed content in the the dropdown or restrictions of the 
selectable content etc.

It has two great advantages over the default `Listbox` / `Resource List` 
template variable types:
- Select more than one item (i.e. resource)
- Ajax based list (works fast with a lot of selectable items by pagination)
