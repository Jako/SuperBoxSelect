## Features

Advanced `Listbox` / `Resource List` template variable type for MODx Revolution
based on the SuperBoxSelect ExtJS Plugin. The template variable displays
selected items (i.e. resources or other supported types) as labelled boxes
within the form field. The item(s) could be searched by autocomplete in the
combo box. In the Input Options of the template variable are a lot of options
available to i.e. the listed content in the the dropdown or restrictions of the
selectable content etc.

It has two great advantages over the default listbox/resource list template
variable types:
- Select more than one item (i.e. multiple resources)
- Ajax based list (works fast with a lot of selectable items by pagination)
